# Intro to Data Analysis with Python

## Vancouver Datajam 2020 Workshop

This beginner level workshop will introduce data analysis with Python, focusing on Jupyter notebooks, working with data in Pandas, and simple plotting (Seaborn and Plotly). A familiarity with Python basics will help you get the most out of this workshop, but you do not need any prior experience with Pandas or any other libraries.


### Lessons

The lessons are available online **[here](https://jenfly.github.io/datajam-python/0-jupyter.html)**.

### Setup

We'll be using Python 3.8, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly. You can work through the lessons and exercises online, without installing any software on the computer (see the workshop document for info).
